<h1>Swipe3DRotateView</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Swipe3DRotateView is a class designed to simplify the implementation of 3D Flip Rotation in android based on swipe gestures.

Swipe3DRotateView is extended from a Framelayout and should exactly contain 2 views as its children. It detects swipe gestures on its child view, and based on the swipe direction, rotates the children in a 3D manner on their X or Y axis.
